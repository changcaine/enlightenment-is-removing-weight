    <p>The Buddhist idea of enlightenment is often popularly imagined as gaining insight or achieving some transcendent illumination—<strong>a moment of light</strong>. But a more nuanced and traditional interpretation reveals something subtler and perhaps more profound: <strong>enlightenment not as an addition, but as a removal</strong>—not as <em>shedding light</em>, but as <em>shedding weight</em>.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3 class="western"><strong>1. Enlightenment as Unburdening</strong></h3>
    <p>At its core, Buddhism sees suffering (dukkha) as arising from clinging—attachments, aversions, delusions. These are like weights we carry, often unknowingly. The path to enlightenment is not about acquiring something new, but <strong>letting go</strong>: of desires, of ego, of the illusion of permanence.</p>
    <p>In this light, enlightenment is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Not illumination but liberation</strong>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Not a flame that reveals truth, but a release from what obscures it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Not adding clarity, but <strong>removing the veils</strong> that distort it.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h3 class="western"><strong>2. The Image of Shedding</strong></h3>
    <p>Many metaphors in Buddhist texts support this vision:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>A snake shedding its skin.</p></li>
        <li><p>Clouds clearing from the sky.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dust being wiped from a mirror.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These all imply that the <strong>original nature of mind is already clear</strong>, already luminous (as in <em>prabhāsvara citta</em> – the innate radiance of mind in some Mahayana traditions). What’s required is not more light, but <strong>less obstruction</strong>.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3 class="western"><strong>3. The Weight of the Self</strong></h3>
    <p>The heaviest burden is often the self: the constant project of maintaining "I", "me", "mine". Enlightenment, then, can be seen as <strong>the lightness of no longer needing to be someone</strong>. It is the end of the exhausting performance of identity, craving, and control.</p>
    <p>When this weight is lifted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>There’s no self to defend.</p></li>
        <li><p>No craving to chase.</p></li>
        <li><p>No past to regret or future to fear.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As Zen master Dōgen put it:</p>
    <blockquote>“To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things.”</blockquote>
    <hr>

    <h3 class="western"><strong>4. Everyday Lightness</strong></h3>
    <p>This weightlessness manifests not in mystical detachment, but in <strong>ease, spontaneity, and compassion</strong>. A truly "enlightened" person doesn't float above the world, glowing—they move <em>through</em> the world with light steps, unburdened by illusion.</p>
    <p>Think of the laugh of a Zen master—free, unencumbered, even irreverent. Or the quiet stillness of a monk sweeping the floor. These are not the fireworks of revelation, but the quiet grace of <strong>nothing left to prove or protect</strong>.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3 class="western"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
    <p>So rather than imagining enlightenment as gaining something extraordinary, it might be more accurate—and more useful—to see it as the <strong>letting go of everything unnecessary</strong>. Not a blaze of light, but a dropping of baggage. Not becoming more, but becoming <strong>less</strong>—until what remains is just presence, peace, and freedom.</p>
    <p><strong>Not adding light. Removing weight.</strong></p>
